Heimdal/Kadm5 version 0.08
==========================

Heimdal::Kadm5 is a Perl XS wrapper around the Heimdal Kerberos
administrative client library (libkadm5clnt).  Heimdal is a free slightly
less export challenged implementation of Kerberos5 by Assar Westerlund and
Johan Danielsson.  This module exposes the API used to administer a
Kerberos realm: add, remove, and list principals, create keytabs, change
keys, and similar operations.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the Kerberos administration client library for
Heimdal (libkadm5clnt) and its corresponding header files.  It finds the
path to the library and header files using krb5-config.

Only Heimdal is supported.  This module will not work with MIT Kerberos
and its Kerberos administration client library, despite similarities in
library and header file names.
